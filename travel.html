            <p class="p1">Maldives is an archipelagic state and country in South Asia, situated in the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south.</p>
            <p class="p2">Maldives offers such an incredible combination of dazzling beaches, cerulean waters and fantastic diving that its opening up to travelers without limitless financial resources is definitely a cause for celebration.</p>

            <p class="p1">The national capital of Italy remains a historical and political hub today. Nicknamed the “Eternal City,” Rome is considered the origination of the Catholic Church and Roman civilization central to the development of the Western World. Divided into 22 walled rioni (districts) surrounded by 35 quartieri urbani (urban sectors) that are surrounded by 6 large suburbi (suburbs), the city, just larger than New York City at an area of 496 mi2,  is home to 2.8 million residents. Its economy runs on the tourism and services industries, the latter mostly in government jobs.</p>     
            <p class="p2">The Via del Corso, named after Roman carnival horse races, is the main street that runs through Rome. Many significant churches, palaces, and squares run along this road (Piazza del Popolo, and the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna, for example). The seven hills that surround Rome are trenched with mythological history which can be seen through the prevalence of temples. Must see landmarks for those traveling include the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and Catacombs. St. Peter’s Square & Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, technically located within Vatican City – an independent city-state within Rome – are also worth a visit.</p>

The park is a well-known attraction to many tourists, receiving more than a million visitors annually. In addition to its collection of giant trees, Sequoia National Park is also home to thousands of prevalent flora and fauna.</p>
            <p class="p2">Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring in at 275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding landscape and the people who come to view it. As of today, the General Sherman tree is estimated to be around 2200 years old.</p>
